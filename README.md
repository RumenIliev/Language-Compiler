<h1 align="center">Language Compiler</h1>
<p align="justify">This is a compiler for a language called "Simple-P-1", consisting of a lexical analyzer (lexer), parser, and code generator, which translates the code directly into assembly language.<br><br>The lexer tokenizes the input code, handling keywords, identifiers, numbers, special symbols, and comments, while also detecting unexpected symbols.<br><br>The parser ensures syntax and semantic correctness, constructing a symbol table to manage variable declarations and scopes, and ensures proper operator usage.<br><br>The code generator translates the parsed code directly into assembly code for arithmetic and logical operations, as well as I/O operations. The generated assembly code is verified to produce correct results when translated into Python or other programming language, ensuring the correctness of the entire compilation process.<br><br>Comprehensive error handling is implemented at each stage, providing robust feedback for invalid syntax and semantic issues.</p>
